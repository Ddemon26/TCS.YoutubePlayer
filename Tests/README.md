## Usage for Future Development

### Before Starting Work
1. Run tests to establish baseline: `dotnet run`
2. Ensure all testable components pass

### During Development
1. Run tests frequently to catch regressions
2. Add new tests for any new functionality

### Before Completing Work
1. **MANDATORY**: Run full test suite
2. All testable components must pass
3. Add tests for new features
4. Update existing tests if behavior changed

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

This testing system is referenced in the main `CLAUDE.md` file to ensure future AI agents understand the mandatory testing requirements.

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Return code 0 = Success
- ‚ùå Return code 1 = Failures that must be fixed
- üéØ Target: 100% success rate for testable components
